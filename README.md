# odin-recipes

## Project overview
This recipe project is the first project from The Odin Project Foundations path. The goal is to create an index page which then link to 3 recipe pages in separate HTML page using relative links. In the recipe page, there will be some descriptions on how to prepare the recipe together with an image.

## Thoughts on this project
This project is a relatively simple project since a lot of guidance were given. I tried my best to follow exactly what is required, but I do add some basic inline CSS styling to improve the page appearance. Overall, pretty satisfied with the project because I tried to implement everything I have learnt so far in this project.
